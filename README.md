My personal configuration presets for common toolchain components

> All of these presets are turn-key, which means they are single install and include all of the dependencies needed to support the configuration. This is not ideal (or recommended) for all situations. For most use cases, these dependencies should be defined as `peerDependencies` instead. These configurations are intended for my own use to make adding configuration as fast and as easy as possible.

## REPO TODO

- [ ] Update tooling to auto update all README files
- [x] Add a `./templates` directory with some "create app" boilerplate templates that use these configs
  - [x] Add to yarn workspaces config
  - [x] Determine if `./packages` still makes sense or if that should move to `./configs`
- [ ] Create a working list of a few other configs/templates that are needed
