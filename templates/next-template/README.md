This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`@bjeco/next-template`](https://github.com/brianespinosa/configs/tree/main/templates/next-template)

## Opinionated

This template is a little more opinionated than the default [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) template.

- More organized folder structure
- CSS normalize
- Personal file structure preferences

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
